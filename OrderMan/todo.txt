- Code to verify orderman.ini capital against Actual - say within x% 












Bug
    - Update Target sometimes updates stop instead with bad qty
    - trackerCallback() -> this.target.isPartiallyFilled()  commented        
        update flow conflicts with tracker thread ? 
GUI calls from trade with GUI in different context can overwrite current context
    // Look if any calls left
    // for all, check how loadTradeToContext() loads data 
Order - Verify all fields after setting and before submit
    Maybe also verify after order creation
Current Status (Partial/Stop X) after Add ? What should it show ?
